## How to Use üöÄ

There are two ways to use Walletize:

### 1. Managed Service

Visit [www.walletize.app](https://www.walletize.app) to use the managed version. This is the easiest way to get started - simply create an account and start tracking your finances. The managed version includes automatic updates, backups, and technical support.

### 2. Self-Hosting with Docker

Before self-hosting Walletize, you'll need to set up the Walletize server first:

Set up [Walletize/server](https://github.com/Walletize/server) by following the instructions in its README

Once you have the server running, you can proceed with setting up the web application:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Walletize/web.git walletize-web
   cd walletize-web
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables, and adjust them accordingly (or copy `.env.example`):
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL="http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:3101"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:3100"
   DISABLE_SIGNUP=false #You can disable the signup page by setting this to true
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t walletize-web .
   docker run -d -p 3101:3101 --name walletize-web walletize-web
   ```

4. Access Walletize at `http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:3101`
